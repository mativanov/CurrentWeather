# Current weather

## Description
Welcome to the README file for the "Current Weather" web app! This application provides real-time weather information for any location, allowing users to stay up-to-date with the latest weather conditions. Developed as a learning project by Mateja Ivanov, this weather app offers several key features, such as viewing the current weather and the UV index for a specific location. Additionally, it supports a dark theme, enhancing visibility in low-light conditions.

## Features

1. Current Weather
Users can search for a city or location of interest using the search input field. After entering the desired location and pressing the "Confirm" button or hitting Enter, the app fetches and displays the current weather conditions, including the temperature and a brief description of the weather.

2. UV Index
For those concerned about sun exposure and ultraviolet radiation, the app supplies the UV index for the chosen location. The UV index helps users understand the level of ultraviolet radiation at the current time, assisting in taking appropriate precautions for skin protection.

3. Dark Theme
Recognizing the importance of user experience, the app includes a dark theme option. By clicking the "Change Theme" button located at the top right corner of the app, users can switch to the dark theme. This modification changes the background color and styling of elements to ensure improved visibility in low-light environments. Toggling back to the default light theme is as simple as clicking the button again.

## How to Use

Enter the name of the city or location of interest in the search input field.
Press the "Confirm" button or simply hit Enter to initiate the weather information search.
The app will display the current weather information, including the temperature, a concise weather description, and an icon representation of the current weather condition.
To enhance visibility in low-light conditions, click the "Change Theme" button located at the top right corner of the app. Clicking the button again will revert the theme back to the default light theme.

## Technologies Used

The "Current Weather" web app is built using several fundamental web technologies, ensuring its functionality and user interface are seamless and reliable:

HTML: The structure of the app's user interface is designed using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the standard language for creating web pages.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is utilized to control the app's visual appearance, including styling elements, layouts, and responsiveness.

JavaScript: As a versatile and dynamic scripting language, JavaScript is the driving force behind the app's interactive features, real-time weather updates, and API calls.

OpenWeatherMap API: To provide users with real-time weather data, the app relies on the OpenWeatherMap API. This API enables the fetching of weather information for a specified location, allowing the app to display accurate and up-to-date weather details.
